## **L – LOOK**
“What do I see?”

Check:
- sender  
- website address  
- spelling errors  
- strange popups  

---

## **E – EVALUATE**
“Does this make sense?”

Is the AI asking for something unusual?  
Does the tone feel rushed or off?

---

## **A – ACT**
Pick your path:

- 🟢 Safe → Continue  
- 🟡 Unsure → Pause & verify  
- 🔴 Wrong → Stop, screenshot, close  

---

## **P – PROTECT**
Strengthen safety:

- Turn on MFA  
- Update passwords  
- Report suspicious messages
