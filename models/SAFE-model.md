S.A.F.E. = **Source – Ask – Feel – Exit**

A simple threat check for kids, families, seniors, and beginners.

## **S – SOURCE**
“Who is talking to me?”

- Is this a real website/app?  
- Does the message come from someone I know?  
- Does anything look strange?

---

## **A – ASK**
“What does it want?”

- Is it asking for:
  - passwords  
  - codes  
  - money  
  - card numbers  
  - personal info

If yes → danger.

## **F – FEEL**
“How does this make me feel?”

- Rushed  
- Scared  
- Confused  
- Too good to be true  

Your body is an alarm.

## **E – EXIT & EXPLAIN**
If anything feels wrong:

- Stop  
- Close the tab/app  
- Tell someone (parent, teacher, IT, bank)
